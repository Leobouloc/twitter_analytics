# Twitter Analytics

This projects aims at creating a partial twitter user graph for the purpose of various exploratory analytics.

The initial goal was to cluster french rappers based on there twitter followers to see what comes out (is the structure that comes out the expected one ?).



Nb: All `csv`'s use `;` as a separator to make them readable on my French version of Excel.
